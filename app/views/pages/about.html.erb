<h1>About me</h1>

<h2> Coding = art </h2>
<p>I have always been very passionate about art.</p>
<p>Art allows us to share our experiences. It allows us to express ourselves</p>
<p>This is exactly what coding means to me. And what it can mean to so many people around us.</p>
<p>Like great art, great code captivates you and lets you discover and learn more each time you interact with it.</p>
